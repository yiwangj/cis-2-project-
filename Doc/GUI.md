# GUI introduction
Here is the user study written for Laminectomy.We designed a user-friendly GUI system using pyqt5, the system contains five parts, voxel-color shows the drilling results of eleven participants under 10 laminectomies, We can load 5 color cases and 5 noncolor cases at the same time in a result showing page, which allows users to compare the effect of navigation system and non-navigation system more intuitively. Click the video button to watch the whole process of drilling by one of the participants, and press record to pause the video at any time during the process. Force boxplot, time boxplot and red voxel-removed boxplot show the results of drilling in navigated and non-navigated systems, respectively. The comparison of the force used in the average stroke, the time taken to complete the drill and the number of bad areas removed under the navigated system.



# How to use
All the code can be found in the GUI documentation under the code documentation

main_gui.py is to run the GUI system

mainwindow.py define the buttons of GUI system.
