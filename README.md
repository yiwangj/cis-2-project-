# introduction
This is the repository for the CIS II project:Virtual Reality Simulator for Laminectomy ( data analysis part)
## How to use
The code file contains five sub-files, the GUI contains all the code to create a GUI system, the Data Extraction contains the code needed to extract the corresponding data from hdf5 and store it in a csv file, the Data analysis contains the code needed to calculate the drilling time, drilling Data analysis contains the code needed to calculate drilling time, drilling force, voxel-removed. merge.py is used to merge hdf5 files, can be more convenient for data operations. readhdf5.py shows how to open the hdf5 file and view its structure. 

IMG file contains five images, the first image shows a progression of non-navigated and navigated cases with respect to the types of voxels removed (both being colored) and both with about the same progression (i.e. at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% completion times respectively).The third image shows the status of participants' force use in the navigated and non-navigated cases, and the fourth shows the number of voxels (bad area) removed in red. The fifth picture shows the situation of drilling time
